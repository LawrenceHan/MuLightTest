## The Problem

We would like you to build a simplified photo booth application which allows the user to take photos and see previously taken photos.

Provide 2 options in the main screen:

● Take a photo

● View Photos

When user selects “Take a photo”, allow the user to take a photo using the default mobile camera functionality, and then allow the user to give the photo a name. The photo, name and creation time should be stored on the device locally. When done, the app should return to the main screen.

When user selects “View Photos”, show a list view with the thumbnails, name and creation time of all photos in the database. When an item in the list is clicked, show the selected photo in full screen with an option to go back to the list view.
